You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* What new skills have you learned?

I've learned a lot from Udacity, despite being a Senior Software Engineer. I had no idea <figure> and <figcaption> even existed! This really got me thinking that HTML comes from an academic background, and it makes sense that it was originally used in academia.

I enjoy Udacity because the
courses focus on fundamentals and are very comprehensive.

Using MDN as element reference is also a really useful skill I learned. I'll be doing this much more often now.

I also enjoy how Udacity highly recommends/enforces using alternative descriptions. Sometimes I've found myself neglecting this in the past, but I
believe I am getting in the habit of using this now.

I never knew <sub> was for subscript text and that <s> was for strikethrough!

Finally, the most awesome thing ever is the https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea HTML validator!

* What has been easy?

Templating out the mock websites. I felt it was pretty straightforward, having done this so many times. Referring to the MDN reference really helped me make
the footer and source annotation; I love referring to documentation.

* What has been difficult?

There have been a few challenges, such as determining when to use <i> italics and <em>. I've noticed cases where an entire paragraph was italicized, and it confused me whether this is intended to be emphasis or not.

Remembering to add in the alt tag is also pretty difficult and it's a habit I need to get used to.

Remembering the different tags and attributes that go inside <head> has always been scary for me since I was a kid. But I am glad that I finally am getting used to this. <meta> tag has always been so confusing.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I started referencing the MDN element reference (which is really cool btw). This definitely helped figure out how on earth I'd create a subscript, strikethrough, and a horizontal rule! Documentation is a life saver.

Using alt tags has been helpful.

Finally. I used the https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea HTML validator to validate the HTML I made and I got "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

This is tremendously useful. Thank you guys for teaching me this.
